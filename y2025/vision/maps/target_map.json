/* Targets have positive Z axis pointing into the board, positive X to the right
   when looking at the board, and positive Y is down when looking at the board.
   This means that you will get an identity rotation from the camera to target
   frame when the target is upright, flat, and centered in the camera's view.

   The global frame as the origin at the center of the field, positive X points
   at the red driver's station, and positive Z points straight up.
